# Clustering Customer Segmentation for Marketing

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is one of the most important applications of clustering algorithms in marketing. As a manager of an online store, the goal is to group customers into different clusters to tailor customized marketing campaigns for each group. Clustering helps uncover patterns in customer data and forms segments based on shared characteristics without the need for predefined labels such as "good" or "bad" customers.

This project leverages clustering techniques to automatically segment customers based on their behaviors, preferences, and demographic data, enabling better-targeted marketing strategies.

## Problem Statement

You have no predefined labels for customer groups, and your task is to segment customers solely based on the patterns observed in the data. The segmentation process will be driven by clustering algorithms, which will identify similar groups of customers based on factors such as:
- Demographics (age, gender, income)
- Purchase behavior (frequency, amount, preferences)
- Interests or affinities (category preferences, browsing habits)

The goal is to identify groups of customers with common characteristics, so you can deliver more personalized and relevant marketing campaigns.

## How Clustering Works

Clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering group data points into clusters based on the similarities between them. In this project, youâ€™ll use unsupervised learning, where the algorithm identifies clusters without any prior labels, providing valuable insights that can drive business decisions.

## Key Features

- **Segmentation of Customers**: Group customers based on their purchasing behaviors, demographic information, and interests.
- **Targeted Marketing Campaigns**: Once customers are segmented into distinct groups, create personalized marketing campaigns to increase engagement.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The algorithm automatically determines the number and types of customer segments based on the data, removing the need for manual group definitions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data processing and model implementation.
- **Scikit-learn**: A machine learning library that provides clustering algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data transformations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and displaying the clustering results.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kudnan-d/clustering-customer-segmentation-marketing.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd clustering-customer-segmentation-marketing
   ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**:

   Upload or use your own dataset with customer data, or download the sample dataset provided in the repository.

4. **Run the Clustering Script**:

   To segment customers into groups, run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python customer_segmentation.py
   ```

5. **Visualize the Results**:

   After segmentation, you can visualize the customer groups using the plotted cluster distributions. This helps in analyzing the different customer segments.

## Example of Results

After performing clustering, you will have:
- **Customer Segments**: Groups of customers who share similar features.
- **Insights**: Understand characteristics for each segment, such as high-value customers, frequent shoppers, and those with specific preferences.
- **Marketing Strategy**: Develop targeted campaigns tailored to each group, increasing engagement and sales.

## Conclusion

By using clustering techniques, businesses can uncover hidden patterns in their customer data and create more effective marketing strategies. This approach helps in delivering highly personalized content, improving customer satisfaction, and driving sales performance.
